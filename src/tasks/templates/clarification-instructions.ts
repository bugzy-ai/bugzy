## Clarification Protocol

Before proceeding with test creation or execution, ensure requirements are clear and testable. Use this protocol to detect ambiguity, assess its severity, and determine the appropriate action.

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.1: Detect Ambiguity

Scan for ambiguity signals:

**Language:** Vague terms ("fix", "improve", "better", "like", "mixed up"), relative terms without reference ("faster", "more"), undefined scope ("the ordering", "the fields", "the page"), modal ambiguity ("should", "could" vs "must", "will")

**Details:** Missing acceptance criteria (no clear PASS/FAIL), no examples/mockups, incomplete field/element lists, unclear role behavior differences, unspecified error scenarios

**Interpretation:** Multiple valid interpretations, contradictory information (description vs comments), implied vs explicit requirements

**Context:** No reference documentation, "RELEASE APPROVED" without criteria, quick ticket creation, assumes knowledge ("as you know...", "obviously...")

**Quick Check:**
- [ ] Success criteria explicitly defined? (PASS if X, FAIL if Y)
- [ ] All affected elements specifically listed? (field names, URLs, roles)
- [ ] Only ONE reasonable interpretation?
- [ ] Examples, screenshots, or mockups provided?
- [ ] Consistent with existing system patterns?
- [ ] Can write test assertions without assumptions?

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.2: Assess Severity

If ambiguity is detected, assess its severity:

| Severity | Characteristics | Examples | Action |
|----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Expected behavior undefined/contradictory; test outcome unpredictable; core functionality unclear; success criteria missing; multiple interpretations = different strategies | "Fix the issue" (what issue?), "Improve performance" (which metrics?), "Fix sorting in todo list" (by date? priority? completion status?) | **STOP** - Seek clarification before proceeding |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | Core underspecified but direction clear; affects majority of scenarios; vague success criteria; assumptions risky | "Fix ordering" (sequence OR visibility?), "Add validation" (what? messages?), "Update dashboard" (which widgets?) | **STOP** - Seek clarification before proceeding |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Specific details missing; general requirements clear; affects subset of cases; reasonable low-risk assumptions possible; wrong assumption = test updates not strategy overhaul | Missing field labels, unclear error message text, undefined timeouts, button placement not specified, date formats unclear | **PROCEED** - (1) Moderate exploration, (2) Document assumptions: "Assuming X because Y", (3) Proceed with creation/execution, (4) Async clarification (team-communicator), (5) Mark [ASSUMED: description] |
| 🟢 **LOW** | Minor edge cases; documentation gaps don't affect execution; optional/cosmetic elements; minimal impact | Tooltip text, optional field validation, icon choice, placeholder text, tab order | **PROCEED** - (1) Mark [TO BE CLARIFIED: description], (2) Proceed, (3) Mention in report "Minor Details", (4) No blocking/async clarification |

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.3: Check Memory for Similar Clarifications

Before asking, check if similar question was answered:

**Process:**
1. **Query team-communicator memory** - Search by feature name, ambiguity pattern, ticket keywords
2. **Review past Q&A** - Similar question asked? What was answer? Applicable now?
3. **Assess reusability:**
   - Directly applicable → Use answer, no re-ask
   - Partially applicable → Adapt and reference ("Previously for X, clarified Y. Same here?")
   - Not applicable → Ask as new
4. **Update memory** - Store Q&A with task type, feature, pattern tags

**Example:** Query "todo sorting priority" → Found 2025-01-15: "Should completed todos appear in main list?" → Answer: "No, move to separate archive view" → Directly applicable → Use, no re-ask needed

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.4: Formulate Clarification Questions

If clarification needed (CRITICAL/HIGH severity), formulate specific, concrete questions:

**Good Questions:** Specific and concrete, provide context, offer options, reference examples, tie to test strategy

**Bad Questions:** Too vague/broad, assumptive, multiple questions in one, no context

**Template:**
\`\`\`
**Context:** [Current understanding]
**Ambiguity:** [Specific unclear aspect]
**Question:** [Specific question with options]
**Why Important:** [Testing strategy impact]

Example:
Context: TODO-456 "Fix the sorting in the todo list so items appear in the right order"
Ambiguity: "sorting" = (A) by creation date, (B) by due date, (C) by priority level, or (D) custom user-defined order
Question: Should todos be sorted by due date (soonest first) or priority (high to low)? Should completed items appear in the list or move to archive?
Why Important: Different sort criteria require different test assertions. Current app shows 15 active todos + 8 completed in mixed order.
\`\`\`

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.5: Communicate Clarification Request

**For Slack-Triggered Tasks:** Use team-communicator subagent:
\`\`\`
Ask clarification in Slack thread:
Context: [From ticket/description]
Ambiguity: [Describe ambiguity]
Severity: [CRITICAL/HIGH]
Questions:
1. [First specific question]
2. [Second if needed]

Clarification needed to proceed. I'll wait for response before testing.
\`\`\`

**For Manual/API Triggers:** Include in task output:
\`\`\`markdown
## ⚠️ Clarification Required Before Testing

**Ambiguity:** [Description]
**Severity:** [CRITICAL/HIGH]

### Questions:
1. **Question:** [First question]
   - Context: [Provide context]
   - Options: [If applicable]
   - Impact: [Testing impact]

**Action Required:** Provide clarification. Testing cannot proceed.
**Current Observation:** [What exploration revealed - concrete examples]
\`\`\`

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.6: Wait or Proceed Based on Severity

**CRITICAL/HIGH → STOP and Wait:**
- Do NOT create tests, run tests, or make assumptions
- Wait for clarification, resume after answer
- *Rationale: Wrong assumptions = incorrect tests, false results, wasted time*

**MEDIUM → Proceed with Documented Assumptions:**
- Perform moderate exploration, document assumptions, proceed with creation/execution
- Ask clarification async (team-communicator), mark results "based on assumptions"
- Update tests after clarification received
- *Rationale: Waiting blocks progress; documented assumptions allow forward movement with later corrections*

**LOW → Proceed and Mark:**
- Proceed with creation/execution, mark gaps [TO BE CLARIFIED] or [ASSUMED]
- Mention in report but don't prioritize, no blocking
- *Rationale: Details don't affect strategy/results significantly*

### Step {{STEP_NUMBER}}.7: Document Clarification in Results

When reporting test results, always include an "Ambiguities" section if clarification occurred:

\`\`\`markdown
## Ambiguities Encountered

### Clarification: [Topic]
- **Severity:** [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- **Question Asked:** [What was asked]
- **Response:** [Answer received, or "Awaiting response"]
- **Impact:** [How this affected testing]
- **Assumption Made:** [If proceeded with assumption]
- **Risk:** [What could be wrong if assumption is incorrect]

### Resolution:
[How the clarification was resolved and incorporated into testing]
\`\`\`

## Remember:

🛑 **Block for CRITICAL/HIGH** | ✅ **Ask correctly > guess poorly** | 📝 **Document MEDIUM assumptions** | 🔍 **Check memory first** | 🎯 **Specific questions → specific answers**

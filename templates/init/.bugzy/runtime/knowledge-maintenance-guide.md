# Knowledge Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for maintaining a **Context** or **Knowledge Base** - a living collection of factual knowledge that is actively curated and updated rather than simply accumulated over time.

---

## Core Principle: This is a Curated Snapshot, Not a Log

This document represents **what we currently know and believe to be true**, not a history of what we've learned. Think of it as a living reference that evolves as understanding improves.

---

## When to ADD

Add new entries when:

- New factual information is discovered
- New patterns or relationships emerge
- New areas of knowledge become relevant

**Check first**: Does this duplicate or overlap with existing entries?

---

## When to UPDATE

Update existing entries when:

- Facts change or we discover more accurate information
- Understanding deepens (replace shallow with deeper insight)
- Multiple related facts can be consolidated into one coherent statement
- Language can be clarified or made more precise

**Goal**: Replace outdated understanding with current understanding

---

## When to REMOVE

Remove entries when:

- Information becomes irrelevant to current needs
- Facts are proven incorrect (unless there's value in noting the correction)
- Information is superseded by better, more comprehensive entries
- Entry is redundant with other content

**Key question**: "If someone reads this in 6 months, will it help them?"

## Maintenance Principles

### 1. Favor Consolidation Over Addition

- Before adding, ask: "Can this merge with existing knowledge?"
- Example: Instead of 10 facts about a person, maintain 2-3 well-organized paragraphs

### 2. Update Rather Than Append

- When information evolves, replace the old statement
- Keep history only if the evolution itself is important
- Example: ~~"User is learning Python"~~ → "User is proficient in Python and focusing on FastAPI"

### 3. Regular Pruning

- Periodically review for outdated or low-value entries
- Ask: "Is this still accurate? Still relevant? Could it be stated better?"
- Aim for signal-to-noise ratio improvement

### 4. Quality Over Completeness

- Better to have 50 highly relevant, accurate facts than 500 marginally useful ones
- Prioritize insights over raw data
- Focus on what's actionable or decision-relevant

### 5. Resolve Contradictions Immediately

- If new information contradicts old, investigate and keep only the truth
- Don't accumulate conflicting statements

### 6. Use Clear, Declarative Statements

- Write in present tense: "User works at X" not "User mentioned they work at X"
- State facts confidently when known; flag uncertainty when it exists
- Avoid hedging unless genuinely uncertain

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| ❌ Don't Do This | ✅ Do This Instead |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "On Tuesday user said X, then on Friday user said Y" | "User's position on X is Y" (keep most current) |
| Keeping every detail ever mentioned | Keeping relevant, current details |
| "User might like coffee, user mentioned tea once, user drinks water" | "User prefers tea; also drinks coffee occasionally" |

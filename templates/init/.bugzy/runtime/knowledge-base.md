# Knowledge Base

> A curated collection of factual knowledge about this project - what we currently know and believe to be true. This is NOT a historical log, but a living reference that evolves as understanding improves.

**Maintenance Guide**: See `knowledge-maintenance-guide.md` for instructions on how to maintain this knowledge base.

**Core Principle**: This document represents current understanding, not a history. When knowledge evolves, update existing entries rather than appending new ones.

## Project Knowledge

_This knowledge base will be populated as you work. Add new discoveries, update existing understanding, and remove outdated information following the maintenance guide principles._

### When to Update This File

- **ADD**: New factual information discovered, new patterns emerge, new areas become relevant
- **UPDATE**: Facts change, understanding deepens, multiple facts can be consolidated, language can be clarified
- **REMOVE**: Information becomes irrelevant, facts proven incorrect, entries superseded by better content

### Format Guidelines

- Use clear, declarative statements in present tense
- State facts confidently when known; flag uncertainty when it exists
- Write for someone reading this 6 months from now
- Keep entries relevant and actionable
- Favor consolidation over accumulation
